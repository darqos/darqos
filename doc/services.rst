Services
========

Much of the DarqOS functionality is implemented as a set of system
*services* providing functionality via the system IPC mechanism.  In a
similar way to many micro-kernels, few if any user applications could
function using the *p-kernel* functionality alone.

In the first edition, the following services exist:

* Terminal
* Security
* Storage
* Metadata
* History
* Index
* Network
* Configuration
