Project Type
============

For some applications, an hierarchical file/directory structure is
needed.  Things like, eg. C or Java code require a directory structure
for header or source code files, for instance.

Aside from these implicit technical assumptions, it might make sense
in more general situations where structured documents are useful.

OTOH, see this article for a discussion of how the use of
file/directory structure might be purely a learned behaviour.
