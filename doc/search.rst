Index Service
=============

The *Index Service* provides both search (query) and index (publish)
functions for a system-wide full-text search facility.  All objects
can, ans should, register their content with the index service,
enabling the common search UI to discover them.  This is especially
important given the deliberate absence of a system-wide hierarchical
storage system.
