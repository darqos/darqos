    """This is a basic text class.  It does not support multiple
    fonts, styles, images, etc.

    So, at one level, this could just be a basic array of Unicode
    code points.  With simple accessors, perhaps a cursor position?
    Helper functions like, line skipping, word-by-word navigation,
    etc.

    Can it support bidi text?  Would that require some metadata to
    identify either a language (with implicit left-to-right/right-to-left
    semantics) or an explicit layout tag?

    What about Asian docs with top-to-bottom layout?

    Does it need to have explicit line structure?  Or is an ASCII CRLF
    sufficient?

    I think it makes sense to store the document as an ordered collection
    of lines, each of which is an ordered collection of words.  I think
    that's universal?  Apparently not: eg, Chinese and Japanese segment
    sentences, Vietnamese segments syllables, European languages
    segment words.  Unicode tech report 14 deals with line break, and
    TR 29 with character and word breaks.

    What about documents with mixed languages?  Especially those with two
    (or more) different presentation styles: eg. right-to-left quotes in
    a left-to-right document, or mixed horizontal and vertical layout?

    I think it's probably a good idea to put that sort of thing into a
    more complex document type?


    These concerns should be addressed for both presentation (read) and
    also editing (write) of such documents.  Editing should include
    features like undo/redo which also impact on the chosen structure.

    The API will need to be careful to distinguish between bytes (if it
    actually exposes them?), code points, graphemes, etc.  There's going
    to be a lot of Unicode algorithm work here.
