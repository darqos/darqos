DarqOS Principles
=================


# FOSS

* You should have the ability to change, revert, extend, examine, etc,
  the software that you use
* Community-developed software should be made available gratis: it's a
  collective endeavour, and builds on a gratis commons

# Open Standards

# Data Sovereignty

* Don't rely on applications or services that own your data
  * It could disappear
  * It could be exposed to other people
  * The price to use it could increase
  * The things you're allowed to do with it could be restricted
  * The service or application could be canceled

* It's fine to synchronize with external data sources
  * There are many useful sources of information, many of which are
    available (more-or-less) gratis
  * Importing data to your own repository is fine
  * Updating your data by referring to an external source is fine

# Trust the User

* Don't hobble the experience in the name of security
* Don't prevent the user from doing things that weren't anticipated
* Provide tools, not shrink-wrapped workflows

# Target Experts

* Users are novices for a very short time
* A consistent experience allows prior experience to be leveraged into
  expertise quickly
* Targeting novices causes inefficiency for experts

# Provide a consistent experience

* Make the user experience consistent: standard appearance, standard
  operations, standard controls, etc
* This facilitates rapid learning, transferable skills, and minimises
  the need to memorize pointless differences

# Connectivity is the Norm

* In 2023, both local and Internet connectivity are the default, and
  are available almost always
* The system should assume connectivity is generally available, but
  should not break without it

# Focus on Data

* Typical applications are silos: it's difficult, if not impossible,
  to bridge between them
* Take inspiration from the NewtonOS soup/store model, Unix plain
  text files, etc.

# Your devices should cooperate

* Most users have multiple devices
* All a users devices should work together
* Minimise duplication of data
* Maximise location transparency

# Minimise Latency

* Despite the many orders of magnitude improvement in speed and
  capacity, modern computers are often sluggish, slower to react than
  computers from the 1980s.
* Remove frippery; retain quality
* Aim for maximum responsiveness
* Aim for minimal background cruft
